Setting up a quick web server in one line
------------------------------------------

> Open the Terminal and navigate to the desired home directory to serve web pages from and run the following command:

> Access your web server at the following url in a browser:

http://RPi_ip_address:8000

Substitute your Raspberry Pi IP Address for RPi_ip_address. E.g. if your ip address is 10.0.0.106 your web server will be
